# Oracle XE 11g on Ubuntu 12.04 using Vagrant

This project enables you to install Oracle 11g XE in a virtual machine running Ubuntu 12.04, using
[Vagrant] and [Puppet].

## Acknowledgements

This project was created based on the information in
[Installing Oracle 11g R2 Express Edition on Ubuntu 64-bit] by Manish Raj, and the GitHub repository
[vagrant-oracle-xe] by Stefan Glase. The former explains how to install Oracle XE 11g on Ubuntu
12.04, without explicitly providing a Vagrant or provisioner configuration. The latter has the same
purpose as this project but uses Ubuntu 11.10.

Thanks to Andr√© Kelpe, Brandon Gresham, Charles Walker, Chris Thompson, Jeff Caddel, Joe FitzGerald,
Justin Harringa, Mark Crossfield, Matthew Buckett, Richard Kolb, and Steven Hsu for various
contributions.

## Requirements

* You need to have [Vagrant] installed.
* The host machine probably needs at least 4 GB of RAM (I have only tested 8 GB of RAM).
* As Oracle 11g XE is only available for 64-bit machines at the moment, the host machine needs to
  have a 64-bit architecture.
* You may need to [enable virtualization] manually.

## Installation

* Check out this project:

        git clone https://github.com/hilverd/vagrant-ubuntu-oracle-xe.git

* Install [vbguest]:

        vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

* Download [Oracle Database 11g Express Edition] for Linux x64. Place the file
  `oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip` in the directory `modules/oracle/files` of this
  project. (Alternatively, you could keep the zip file in some other location and make a hard link
  to it from `modules/oracle/files`.)

* *Optional:* To get [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) integration, download `ojdbc6.jar` for JDK 1.6 from
    [Oracle Database 11g Release 2 11.2.0.4 JDBC Drivers](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-112010-090769.html),
    and place it in the directory `oracle-jdbc` of this project.

    Migrations are in `data-with-flyway/src/main/resources/database/migrations`.
    See `data-with-flyway/README.md` for more instructions.
    Many thanks to [Nicholas Blair](https://github.com/nblair) for contributing this feature.

* Run `vagrant up` from the base directory of this project. The first time this will take a while -- up to 30 minutes on
  my machine. Please note that building the VM involves downloading an Ubuntu 12.04
  [base box](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html) which is 323MB in size.

These steps are also shown in an [asciicast] made by Daekwon Kang:

## Connecting

You should now be able to
[connect](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html) to
the new database at `localhost:1521/XE` as `system` with password `manager`. For example, if you
have `sqlplus` installed on the host machine you can do

    sqlplus system/manager@//localhost:1521/XE

To make sqlplus behave like other tools (history, arrow keys etc.) you can do this:

    rlwrap sqlplus system/manager@//localhost:1521/XE

You might need to add an entry to your `tnsnames.ora` file first:

    XE =
      (DESCRIPTION =
        (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 127.0.0.1)(PORT = 1521))
        (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVER = DEDICATED)
          (SERVICE_NAME = XE)
        )
      )

## Troubleshooting

### Errors when Unzipping

If you get an error containing `/usr/bin/unzip -o oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip returned 2` during `vagrant up`, then the zip file you have downloaded is probably corrupted. This can be fixed by re-downloading, replacing the corrupted file, and running `vagrant reload --provision`.

### Memory

It is important to assign enough memory to the virtual machine, otherwise you will get an error

    ORA-00845: MEMORY_TARGET not supported on this system

during the configuration stage. In the `Vagrantfile` 512 MB is assigned. Lower values may also work,
as long as (I believe) 2 GB of virtual memory is available for Oracle, swap is included in this
calculation.

### Concurrent Connections

If you want to raise the limit of the number of concurrent connections, say to 200, then according
to [How many connections can Oracle Express Edition (XE) handle?] you should run

    ALTER SYSTEM SET processes=200 scope=spfile

and restart the database.
